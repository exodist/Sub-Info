NAME

    Sub::Info - Tool for inspecting subroutines.

DESCRIPTION

    Tool to inspect subroutines.

EXPORTS

    All exports are optional, you must specify subs to import.

    my $hr = sub_info(\&code)

    my $hr = sub_info(\&code, @line_numbers)

      This returns a hashref with information about the sub:

          {
              ref        => \&code,
              cobj       => $cobj,
              name       => "Some::Mod::code",
              file       => "Some/Mod.pm",
              package    => "Some::Mod",
      
              # Note: These have been adjusted based on guesswork.
              start_line => 22,
              end_line   => 42,
              lines      => [22, 42],
      
              # Not a bug, these lines are different!
              all_lines  => [23, 25, ..., 39, 41],
          };

      $info->{ref} => \&code

	This is the original sub passed to sub_info().

      $info->{cobj} => $cobj

	This is the c-object representation of the coderef.

      $info->{name} => "Some::Mod::code"

	This is the name of the coderef. For anonymous coderefs this may
	end with '__ANON__'. Also note that the package 'main' is special,
	and 'main::' may be omitted.

      $info->{file} => "Some/Mod.pm"

	The file in which the sub was defined.

      $info->{package} => "Some::Mod"

	The package in which the sub was defined.

      $info->{start_line} => 22

      $info->{end_line} => 42

      $info->{lines} => [22, 42]

	These three fields are the adjusted start line, end line, and array
	with both. It is important to note that these lines have been
	adjusted and may not be accurate.

	The lines are obtained by walking the ops. As such, the first line
	is the line of the first statement, and the last line is the line
	of the last statement. This means that in multi-line subs the lines
	are usually off by 1. The lines in these keys will be adjusted for
	you if it detects a multi-line sub.

      $info->{all_lines} => [23, 25, ..., 39, 41]

	This is an array with the lines of every statement in the sub.
	Unlike the other line fields, these have not been adjusted for you.
